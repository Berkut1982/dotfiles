# Yalishanda's .files

## Why?
Because I am a try-hard and want an easy-peasy-hacky setup on every machine.

## How?
1. Install needed `zsh` framework, plugins and themes:
- [Oh-My-Zsh!](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
- [Synthax Highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
- [Spaceship Theme](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt)
- [Fish-like Autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)

2. Install (Fira Code || Powerline) fonts:
- [FIRA CODE](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)
- [Powerline Fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/SourceCodePro)

3. Make sure `zsh` is the default shell if not prompted to change it already:
- For normal user: `chsh -s /bin/zsh`
- For root: `sudo chsh -s /bin/zsh`

4. Install Atom's One Dark theme for Vim:
- [Instructions](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim)

5. Use the repo:
- Run the install script:
`./INSTALL.sh`
- Then, at any time, if there is an update available, easily update with:
`./UPDATE.sh`
