# Yalishanda's .files

## Why?
Because I am a try-hard and want an easy-peasy-hacky setup on every machine.

## What does it use?
- [Oh-My-Zsh!](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
- [Synthax Highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
- [Spaceship Theme](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt)
- [Fish-like Autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
- [Atom's One Dark Theme proxy for Vim](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim)

## What do I need to do if I don't have any of these and want them installed automagically?
1. Install (Fira Code || Powerline) fonts and make the terminal use one of them:
- [FIRA CODE](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)
- [Powerline Fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/SourceCodePro)

2. Make sure `zsh` is the default shell:
- For normal user: `chsh -s /bin/zsh`
- For root: `sudo chsh -s /bin/zsh`

3. Abra-cadabra!
- Run the install script:
`./INSTALL.sh` (*WARNING*: This overwrites your `~/.zshrc` content and assumes you haven't installed Oh-My-Zsh! yet. If you have, please remove the folder.)
- Then, at any time, if there is an update available, easily update with:
`./UPDATE.sh`
